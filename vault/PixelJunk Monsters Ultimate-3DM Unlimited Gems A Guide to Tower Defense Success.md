Aside from using the cheat engine, there are also some tips and tricks that can help you get more gems in PixelJunk Monsters Ultimate-3DM. Here are some of them:

- Try to get a perfect score on each level by not letting any of your offspring die. This will reward you with a rainbow gem that can be used to unlock special towers and abilities.
- Use the interest ability to increase your gem income over time. You can unlock this ability by beating Gati Gati island Special 3. The interest rate is based on your current amount of gems, so try to save up as much as you can.
- Use the gem tower to convert coins into gems. You can unlock this tower by beating Toki island Special 1. The gem tower will produce one gem for every 10 coins you collect, but it will also consume one coin per second. Place it near your base or near coin-rich areas for maximum efficiency.
- Use the hive tower to spawn friendly bees that will attack enemies and drop gems. You can unlock this tower by beating Gati Gati island Special 2. The hive tower will produce one bee for every 10 seconds, but it will also consume one gem per second. Place it near enemy paths or near gem-poor areas for maximum benefit.
- Use the flame tower to set enemies on fire and make them drop more gems. You can unlock this tower by beating Tiki island Special 2. The flame tower will deal damage over time and increase the gem drop rate of enemies by 50%. Place it near choke points or near other towers for maximum damage.

With these tips and tricks, you should be able to get more gems in PixelJunk Monsters Ultimate-3DM and enjoy the game even more. Have fun!
