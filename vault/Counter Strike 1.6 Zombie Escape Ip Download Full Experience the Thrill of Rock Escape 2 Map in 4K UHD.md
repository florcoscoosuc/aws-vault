## What is Counter Strike 1.6 Zombie Escape Mod?
 
Counter Strike 1.6 Zombie Escape mod is a game mode where you play as either a human or a zombie.

The round starts with a 20-second phase where humans can choose their weapons from a menu. After that, there is a 7-second phase where zombies are frozen and humans can start running. Then, the main phase begins where zombies can move and hunt down the humans.
